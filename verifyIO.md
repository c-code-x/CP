4. Verifying IO Files
  - In this Stage, CP-Team should verify all the IO files.
  - The CP team should code an algorithm that would check if the IO files followed the specified Format.
  - They should also check if Input files follow the given constraints.
  - If any input file is not following any of the mentioned points above, then both CP-Team must avert the individual IO files.
  - If an input file follows all the rules mentioned above, then CP-Team should test its output file against different solutions with different algorithms.
  - Team must upload IO files strictly after all the above checks are performed and asserted true.
