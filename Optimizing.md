# 2. Optimizing Stage
  - In this Stage, the CP team should come up with the most optimal solution for the conceptual problem.
  
  - An optimal solution is a feasible solution where the objective function reaches its maximum (or minimum) value â€“ for example, the most profit or the least cost. A globally optimal solution is one where there are no other feasible solutions with better objective function values.
  - Soft testing is done on the optimal, checking for memory and time complexities of it.
  - After the Time & memory complexities have been set, CP-Team should calculate the constraints accordingly.
