# 1. Conceptual Stage
 + In this Stage, the CP (Competitive programming) team will search for different concepts and Challenges which could help create a good problem.
 + Each and Every question needs to be logical and clearly explained. 
 + Each and Every Question should be embedded with the theme of the question. 

 On the Problem Statement tab, specify the following:
 ### **A. Problem Name**

The problem name should be short and should not give any hints to solve the problem.
### **B. Tags**

(Optional) Select the Tags from the drop-down list or add your own custom tag.
Tags are words or phrases that help with the searchability and organization of your questions. You can add the existing tags or create new tags. Set the difficulty level for your question by associating the tags as Easy, Medium, or Hard. Alternatively, associate custom tags to identify your question by its complexity or its levels.
When you view your questions in the Library, the associated tags will be indicated for every question. You can use these tags to generate candidate reports and performance graphs.
 Refer to Associating the Tags for Questions for more information.
### **C. Problem Description**

A good problem statement should comprise a clear and detailed problem description, at least one sample test case with an explanation, and constraints of the problem. 
Click on the Templates option to use the predefined HackerRank's Coding Question template to define your problem clearly.
Refer to the Defining the Problem Statement: Coding and Database Engineer Questions topic for more information. 

### **D. Questionnaire Guidelines**

Questionnaire guidelines are for later reference. You can include a rubric about scoring the questions or write solutions to the problems in this section. These can be used by your team while evaluating the test. This step is optional.
