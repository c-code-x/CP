3. Generating IO Files
  - According to the needs of the problem, The CP-Team should frame the input format and output format.
  - With the constraints calculated in the previous Stage, we should generate the IO (Input & Output) files according to the formats.
  - The CP-Team should generate the input files for all ranges of the constraints.
  - The CP-Team should generate the output file from the optimal solution code generated in the optimizing Stage.
