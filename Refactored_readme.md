# **Competetive Programming in Codex:**
**CODEX** is a platform for all enthusiastic tech minds. To know more about codex click [here](./Codex_intro.md). **The competitive Programming Domain** in **Codex** functions to conduct Competitive programming tests like contests and hackathons. This is also called as [CP_Domain](./cp_in_codex.md) in Codex. 

There are two functions of **CODEX** to ensure **Competitive Programming**. They are:
- [Coding Contest](./coding_contest.md)
  * Coding Against Time (CAT)
  * Coding Contest
- [Hackathons](./Hackathons.md) 
 ## **Coding Contest v/s Hackathons**

- The regular Coding contests are conducted online for a maximum of two or three hours.
- Because of the time frame and the venue, we had to limit ourselves to easier coding Challenges and could not implement many exciting features. 
- In contrast, Hackathons will be conducted offline and in longer time slots. 
- We can use the extended time slot to the fullest potential by increasing the number of Challenges with different programming concepts to satisfy the participant's pallet. 
## **Procedures To Conduct Contest**
- Participants can participate in a group. 
Members.
- Participants can discuss among their team.
- Participants can't discuss or share code with other team members.
- It is going to be an open book contest. 
- Hence all the participants can use any online or offline material for reference.
- If similar code submissions are found between two teams, both teams are disqualified.
- **CP_Team** has to follow particular [pattern]() in order to conduct the contests. 
## **Some Of Our Contests & Hackathons**
- [Codex CAT Spiderverse](https://www.hackerrank.com/codex-into-the-spider-verse)
- [Codex Hackathon Multiverse](https://www.hackerrank.com/codex-multiverse-hackathon)
- [Codex MCT Stranger Things](https://www.hackerrank.com/codex-coding-contest) 

## **Procedure To Create a Challenge**
- There are four phases in creating a Challenge:
  1. [Conceptual Stage](./Conceptual_stage.md)
  2. [Optimizing Stage](./Optimizing.md)
  3. [Generating IO Files](./CreateIO.md)
  4. [Verifying IO Files](./verifyIO.md)
